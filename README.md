# AgroWise: Weather and Watering Tracker  
JSP-based weather and watering demo tracker for the five major olive-producing regions in Greece. Designed for Tomcat server deployment, the app helps farmers track monthly watering goals and analyze weather data for optimized olive cultivation.

## About the Project  
AgroWise is a tailored application for olive farmers operating in Greece's six largest olive-producing regions: Heraklion, Chania, Kalamata, Sparti, Pthiotis.  

Built using Java Server Pages (JSP) and designed for deployment on a Tomcat university server, this application combines real-time weather data with personalized irrigation tracking to optimize water usage and support sustainable agriculture.  

## Features  
- **Regional Weather Integration**: Tracks and synchronizes weather data for the five key olive-producing areas in Greece.  
- **Monthly Watering Goals**: Monitors user-defined watering schedules and adjusts targets based on local weather conditions.  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides actionable insights for optimal irrigation planning.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive JSP frontend for seamless interaction.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Backend**: JSP, Java 8  
- **Frontend**: JSP with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Server**: Apache Tomcat  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure the following tools are installed before deploying the application:  
- **Java Development Kit (JDK 8+)**  
- **Apache Tomcat Server (9.0 or higher)**  
- **MySQL Server**  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgroWise-OliveSmart-JSP.git
   cd AgroWise-OliveSmart-JSP
   
## 2. Connect to Your Database

The application requires a MySQL database. Follow these steps to configure your database connection:

### Step 1: Create a MySQL Database
1. Log in to your MySQL server:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE ismgroup21;
### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Define the following environment variables on your system:

- **DB_SERVER**: Database server address (e.g., `195.251.249.131`).
- **DB_SERVER_PORT**: Database server port (e.g., `3306`).
- **DB_NAME**: Name of your database (e.g., `ismgroup21`).
- **DB_USERNAME**: Your database username.
- **DB_PASSWORD**: Your database password.

### On Linux/MacOS
- Use the following commands to set up the environment variables:
   ```bash
   export DB_SERVER=server_ip_adderss
   export DB_SERVER_PORT=3306
   export DB_NAME=your_db_name
   export DB_USERNAME=your_username
   export DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   
### On Windows Command Prompt
- Use the following commands to set up the environment variables:
   ```bash
  set DB_SERVER=server_ip_adderss
  set DB_SERVER_PORT=3306
  set DB_NAME=your_db_name
  set DB_USERNAME=your_username
  set DB_PASSWORD=your_password

### Step 3: Verify Database Connection
- Test the connection by running the application on your Tomcat server.
- Ensure the database schema and tables match the application's requirements.

### Step 4: Deploy on Tomcat
1. Build the project and package it into a WAR file.
2. Deploy the WAR file to your Tomcat server's `webapps` directory.
3. Start Tomcat and access the application at:
   ```bash
   http://<your-server-ip>:<port>/agrowise

### Additional Notes
- **Environment Variables**: Use tools like `.env` files for local development (e.g., `dotenv-java`).
- **Database Scripts**: Include database schema and data population scripts in the `/db` folder if applicable.

### ðŸŽ‰ Final Step: You're Ready to Go!
Grab a cup of coffee, start your Tomcat server, and enjoy using AgroWise! ðŸš€
